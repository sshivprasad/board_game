## Solution Validator for a Board Game

### Instructions to run the code:

1. Create a conda environment with Python 3.9 installed (optional)
2. No external dependencies are required to run the code
3. The main function in the main module contains a hardcoded example of 4 X 4 Board with constraints as 
mentioned in the assignment document, and a valid and an invalid Solution which is instantiated by passing
cell values row-wise as a list
4. Run main to test the validator code for 4 X 4 Board with a valid and an invalid solution
5. Instantiate a Board of any other dimension with the required constraints, instantiate valid and invalid
solutions for the board by passing list of row-wise cell values, and test the validator
6. Test cases have also been included for the Data Classes and the Validator function
